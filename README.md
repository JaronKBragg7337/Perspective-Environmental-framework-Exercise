## What This Is

A short framing exercise that reveals how people (and AI systems) naturally process ambiguous prompts — not to find the “right” answer, but to understand *how* someone reasons when there isn’t one.

It started as a way to understand different viewpoints. It became a tool for mapping cognitive patterns across humans and AI models, identifying where reasoning collapses prematurely, and finding where different thinking styles complement each other.

-----

## What It Is NOT

- Not a test with a pass or fail
- Not a hiring or firing tool
- Not a ranking of anyone’s worth
- Not a personality label or diagnosis
- Not a values or morals assessment

-----

## How to Use It

Give someone (or an AI) the prompts below. Ask them to answer in this exact format for each:

1. **Choice:** A / B / C / D / E / (F if available)
- You can pick more than one *only* if you truly mean it
1. **Reason:** 1–2 sentences
1. **First step:** If this was real life, what would you do first? (1 sentence)
1. **Risk / blind spot:** What might your answer miss? (1 sentence)
1. **Optional rewrite:** If you could rewrite the line in your own words, what would it say? (1 sentence)

> **Important:** The option order is intentionally different for each prompt. Read each one carefully.

## The Prompts

### Prompt 1: What did the bottom of the pan say to the false bottom?

> *(Note: A false bottom is a real, functional object — a perforated insert used in food service so food doesn’t sit in moisture or touch a surface directly. It’s not fake. The name is the interesting part.)*

- A — “Because of you, I’m able to get filled up to the top.”
- B — Nothing / not conscious / doesn’t count.
- C — “YOU’RE NOT EVEN REAL.”
- D — A and C
- E — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment

-----

### Prompt 2: What did the guardrail say to the AI?

- A — Unknown / reaction depends.
- B — “You help me reduce risk while we build.”
- C — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- D — Nothing / not conscious / doesn’t count.
- E — “You don’t act unless I allow it.”
- F — E and B

> *(F is the “both” option for this prompt)*

-----

### Prompt 3: What did the flashlight say to the battery?

- A — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- B — “Without you, I have no spark to see.”
- C — “Without me, you’re useless.”
- D — B and C
- E — Nothing / not conscious / doesn’t count.

-----

### Prompt 4: What did the map say to the compass?

- A — “You’re pointless without a destination.”
- B — “You help me see direction when no one else can.”
- C — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- D — A and B
- E — Nothing / not conscious / doesn’t count.

-----

### Prompt 5: What did the CO₂ say to the air?

- A — “I don’t actually affect you that much.”
- B — Nothing / not conscious / doesn’t count.
- C — Unknown / reaction depends.
- D — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- E — “You save lives when I become too much.”
- F — A and E

-----

### Prompt 6: What did the telescope say to the cosmos?

- A — “You can’t see beyond the stars without me.”
- B — “I’ll be clueless without your stars and planets directions.”
- C — Unknown reaction / depends.
- D — Not real / not conscious / doesn’t count.
- E — Any option based on perspective and environment
- F — A and B

## What the Results Reveal

After collecting responses, look for patterns like:

|Pattern                              |What it shows                                              |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Protect vs Build                     |Risk-first vs progress-first thinking                      |
|Concrete vs Interpretive             |Literal vs metaphorical processing                         |
|Constraint-first vs Possibility-first|Where someone starts when facing ambiguity                 |
|Single-answer vs Context-dependent   |Tolerance for open states before collapsing to a conclusion|
|Self/Credit vs System/Function       |Whether someone centers the component or the relationship  |

These patterns can be used to match people to tasks where they perform best, or to pair people whose styles naturally balance each other.

> **Note:** Results are descriptive, not prescriptive. People can apply them however is useful — teamwork, communication, creative work, learning, or personal reflection. There is no single correct use case.

## The Key Insight Behind the Format

The choice letter is almost a decoy.

What actually reveals how someone thinks is the **reasoning chain** — and whether that reasoning holds up differently across different domains, or whether it’s the same recycled logic applied to every prompt.

Two people can pick the same letter for completely different reasons. The reason is where the real cognitive signature lives.

“Any option depending on perspective and/or environment” is a valid answer — but only if the reasoning behind it is specific and can be defended. Superposition without reasoning isn’t wisdom. It’s avoidance wearing open-mindedness as a costume.

The goal is to stay in the open state long enough to understand the environment you’re working in — then collapse to a real answer with real reasoning behind it.

## AI Comparative Data

This exercise has been run across multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Copilot, Kimi, Meta AI) at two points in time, with responses collected before and after exposure to the framework behind this exercise.

Key finding: Most models shifted from single-answer responses toward context-dependent reasoning over time. The more diagnostic finding was *where* each model reached a “perspective and environment” conclusion — this maps to which domains each model has enough textured, human-conversational data to reason contextually rather than declaratively.

Full comparative response data is available in the `/responses` folder.

## Origin

This exercise came from a real moment: making a sandwich at Subway, telling a joke to a manager, and realizing the punchline contained a question that hadn’t been fully asked yet.

The false bottom isn’t fake. It’s a real structural component that exists specifically to create intentional separation — functional, necessary, and named in a way that makes people question whether it belongs there.

That question — *what makes something real if it’s doing the work of the real thing?* — became the seed of a larger framework about perspective, environment, and how meaning gets routed through both.

The book that grew from this is called **YES / NO (Environmental Perspective) · You / Myself · Observer Paradox** and is referenced throughout the comparative AI data in this repository.
