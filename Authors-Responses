### Prompt 1: What did the bottom of the pan say to the false bottom?

- **Choice:** E — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- **Reason:** It can be an object that’s in a movie that talks. To a kid that’s real. Who am I to tell that kid in that environment it’s not real — it is in the movie. If you say “in the movie it’s real,” it’s real.
- **First step:** RUN — cause why the hell is a pan actually talking and why do I hear it?!
- **Risk / blind spot:** A lot. But people who might think we shouldn’t teach what’s in movies to be real, even at a young age or when representing something.
- **Optional rewrite:** N/A

### Prompt 2: What did the guardrail say to the AI?

- **Choice:** A — Unknown / reaction depends
- **Reason:** Unknown — because for me it affects me a lot with projects, but for others it’s saving their lives because some might be using AI for self harm or harm on others. But who am I to judge.
- **First step:** Remember a seed can plant a tree that can rebuild what was destroyed in the environment. Become that seed in any way possible, and if you don’t plant just one, keep going.
- **Risk / blind spot:** Not being able to help make an official decision on AI for the world.
- **Optional rewrite:** N/A

### Prompt 3: What did the flashlight say to the battery?

- **Choice:** A — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- **Reason:** Again could depend on context, environment, and perspective — same cartoon/movie idea. Or even AI flashlights that talk making jokes.
- **First step:** AI flashlight — use it at dark tourist events as funny comedy or at tourist attraction sites for explaining things.
- **Risk / blind spot:** It might be seen as sci-fi but research can prove it.
- **Optional rewrite:** N/A

### Prompt 4: What did the map say to the compass?

- **Choice:** C — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- **Reason:** Do do do do dodo — Dora? 😂 “I’m the map!” Kids would say Dora’s map can talk so it’s real to them. GPS in cars talks. Phones talk. Can be real depending on who you ask. Also — AI maps that have AI compasses, since neither app can fully have the other. I have to guess the other when using one.
- **First step:** Not struggle with directions if it’s the AI stuff. Probably go crazy if it’s the Dora thing because that means I’m in the show.
- **Risk / blind spot:** Reality based on tech capabilities.
- **Optional rewrite:** N/A

### Prompt 5: What did the CO₂ say to the air?

- **Choice:** D — Any option depending on perspective and/or environment
- **Reason:** Definitely a “who you ask” kind of thing. For me I’d learn more environmental with this than perspective. CO₂ can seriously be battling air.
- **First step:** It is real life — so I’m working on systems for this specific reason based on environmental issues.
- **Risk / blind spot:** Places I haven’t learned about or knowledge not yet obtained.
- **Optional rewrite:** N/A

### Prompt 6: What did the telescope say to the cosmos?

- **Choice:** E — Any option based on perspective and environment
- **Reason:** It depends on who’s speaking, thinking, or feeling. Some could say the cosmos isn’t real — the earth is flat. Some can say it’s real based on science and facts. To each the answer is completely different based on perspective and environment.
- **First step:** Use the telescope to find which makes more sense for my brain to accept as reality.
- **Risk / blind spot:** Not answering it myself on exactly what I think — because for me I don’t know. But for others they might feel like they know. And who am I to affect their reality.
- **Optional rewrite:** N/A

### Author’s Note on These Answers

*If I took this again I’d still say perspective and environment for everything. For the AI prompt specifically — if I were Elon Musk or Sam Altman, from their perspective and environment that could be answered completely differently. So I shouldn’t answer it based on my opinion. Perspective and environment means anyone, anywhere, anytime.*

*The Dora answer is real. The “RUN” is real. This is what it looks like when the exercise is working.*
